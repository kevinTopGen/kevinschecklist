Hi Mike!

Thanks for taking a look. I put together a pretty bare-bones app using React and Redux as you asked.

The project can be view live at https://kevins-checklist.kevintabaei.now.sh

I would love your feedback on whether you think I could have done anything better, or any next steps you deem appropriate.

Note: The "New Folder" button allows you to type the new folder name exactly where the button is located.

Thanks,
Kevin
